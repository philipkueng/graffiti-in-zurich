# Graffiti in Zurich between 2018 and 2020

This is a school project for the subject "Visual Storytelling" in my degree for Interaction Design. The idea of this project is to create a visualization about the reported Graffiti in Zurich from the service "z√ºri-wie-neu" in between the years 2018 and 2020.
